20728,What's the best way to create ClickOnce deployments,<p>Our team develops distributed winform apps. We use ClickOnce for deployment and are very pleased with it.</p> <p>However we've found the pain point with ClickOnce is in <em>creating</em> the deployments. We have the standard dev/test/production environments and need to be able to create deployments for each of these that install and update separate from one another. Also we want control over what assemblies get deployed. Just because an assembly was compiled doesn't mean we want it deployed.</p> <p>The obvious first choice for creating deployments is Visual Studio. However VS really doesn't address the issues stated. The next in line is the SDK tool Mage. Mage works OK but creating deployments is rather tedious and we don't want every developer having our code signing certificate and password.</p> <p>What we ended up doing was rolling our own deployment app that uses the command line version of Mage to create the ClickOnce manifest files.</p> <p>I'm satisfied with our current solution but is seems like there would be an industry-wide accepted approach to this problem. Is there?</p>,20806,2,0,,8/21/2008 18:35:04,5,11/30/2015 2:03:49,11/30/2015 2:03:49,,1321,whatknott,1321,,1,13,winforms|deployment|clickonce,2534

29253893,mixture of left-handed and right-handed philosophers a tricky questions?,<blockquote> <p>Lemma 1: we know at any table with a mixture of left-handed and right-handed philosophers deadlock cannot occur. I very familiar with it proofs.</p> </blockquote> <p>I ran into a following question on Interview recently. </p> <p>There are 5 philosophers sitting at a round table. between each two philosophers there is a chopsticks. each philosophers need two chopsticks to eat. we have two type of philosophers: left-handed and right-handed. left-handed first take a chopsticks with left hands. right-handed first take a chopsticks with right hands. suppose among 5 philosophers there is at least 1 left-handed and at least 1 right-handed. which of them is True:</p> <blockquote> <p>a) independent from the combination of placement philosophers at round table there is no deadlock. (I sure True)</p> <p>b) if all of the philosophers simultaneously take the first chopsticks there is a deadlock. (I thin this is true because in implication if we have a-->b and a is false a-->b is true. and in this option there is no way to all philosopher simultaneously take the first chopsticks so the whole statement is true.)</p> </blockquote> <p>Any expert could help me that I argument is True? </p> <blockquote> <p>Edit 1: I add the proof for Lemma1: (but the question mentioned above has some differences. ) </p> <p>First observe that due to the pattern of resource acquisition around the table there is only one possible wait-cycle i.e. the cycle involving all philosophers. So assume such a deadlock. Every philosopher must be waiting by which we mean waiting for a chopstock held by another. Thus all chopsticks must be held. If our table has a mixture of left-handed and right-handed philosophers there must be at least one pair of adjacent philosophers of opposite handedness. First assume a left-handed philosopher (“Lenny”) seated to the left of a right-handed philosopher (“Roger”). Because all chopsticks must be held either Lenny or Roger must hold the chopstick which is between them. If Lenny holds it that is his “right chopstick” so he must previously have acquired the chopstick to his left. Thus Lenny holds two chopsticks and is not waiting to acquire any (he is eating) so there is not a deadlock. If Roger holds the chopstick which is between them that is his “left chopstick” so he must previously have acquired the chopstock to his right etc. If we call the previous case the “outward reaching” case then the “inward reaching” case is a right-handed philosopher seated to the left of a left-handed philosopher. Again if we have a deadlock all chopsticks must be held so one of them holds the chopstick between them. This means that the other one holds no chopsticks since the one between them is the ﬁrst one each will try to acquire (either Roger reached right and got it or Lenny reached left and got it; the other is waiting for it before reaching in the outward direction). If there are n philosphers and n chopsticks all chopsticks held but one philosopher holds zero chopsticks then n−1 philosophers hold n chopsticks. Some philospher must hold two chopsticks; that philosopher is not waiting (he is eating) so there is no deadlock.</p> </blockquote>,29255521,1,0,,3/25/2015 11:04:43,,3/26/2015 21:06:25,3/25/2015 12:45:26,user4249446,,user4249446,,,1,1,operating-system|deadlock|semaphore|critical-section|dining-philosopher,318

12804074,EventSource listener does not fire on page load in Firefox,<p>i'm a bit confused about the reason it does not work in Firefox when it works in other(all) browsers.</p> <p>Initializing EventSource and registering a listener:</p> <pre><code>var output = new EventSource('/subscribe'); output.addEventListener('shell_stream' function(e) { $('#shell-output').append(e.data + &lt;br/&gt; ); } false); </code></pre> <p>Then on page loading i'm looking through query string and if there is a file and the run action i'm sending them to server(via ajax) and the server sending back the data to the listener registered above.</p> <p>Debugged the script a lot. It does send request and receive valid response and server for sure sending data to listener.</p> <p>However on Firefox the listener does not react in any way.</p> <p>Worth to note what the listener works perfect if the user click Run button which calls exactly the same function which is called on page load if file and run found in query string.</p> <p>Also if I fire an <code>alert()</code> on page load and user click it the listener will work!</p> <p>Here is the live link to try in various browsers:</p> <p><a href= http://cibox.org/slivu/stackoverflow?file=extract-image.rb&amp;run=true rel= nofollow >http://cibox.org/slivu/stackoverflow?file=extract-image.rb&amp;run=true</a></p> <p>Thank you.</p>,13149170,1,6,,10/9/2012 16:08:31,,10/31/2012 14:17:22,10/9/2012 16:26:19,user904990,,user904990,,,1,2,javascript|firefox|server-sent-events,999
14115344,Function not getting called,<p>I'm implementing a http server in C. I have a custom function for writing headers. When I call it it doesn't do anything. I have placed an arbitrary printf inside the function to make sure that it's called and it doesn't produce output too. Program compiles with success and works normally as intended aside from this issue. I can connect to server which results in empty response due to this problem. I can easily use <code>fprintf</code> instead but I want to understand the problem. The function is declared as follows:</p> <pre class= lang-c prettyprint-override ><code>void write_response_ln(FILE *fp char *format ...) { va_list args; printf( dsgsfdg ); strcat(format \r\n ); va_start(args format); vfprintf(fp format args); va_end(args); } </code></pre> <p>It is located in it's own file apart from the file in which the caller is. Even though it is called 4 times client processes report empty response. Why does this happen? BTW I'm using gcc 4.7 on linux to compile this.</p> <p><hr/> Here is the caller function:</p> <pre class= lang-c prettyprint-override ><code>static pid_t handle_connection(size_t bfrsz int fd_connect pid_t kid_pid) { int c; char *headers = malloc(bfrsz); FILE *res = fdopen(fd_connect a+ ); kid_pid = getpid(); bzero(headers bfrsz); fgets(headers bfrsz res); fprintf(stdout REQ: %s\n  headers); write_response_ln(res HTTP 200 OK ); write_response_ln(res Content-Type:text/html ); write_response_ln(res ); write_response_ln(res I don't have a parser yet. ); fclose(res); // Commit suicide. printf( Transaction: Complete: Kill: [%d]\n  kid_pid); sleep(1); kill(kid_pid SIGINT); free(headers); return kid_pid; } </code></pre> <p>And a go with the gdb gave me this:</p> <pre><code>(gdb) break write_response_ln Breakpoint 1 at 0x400f80: file headers.c line 8.

Stick with <code>aio</code>?</p> <p><strong>Aside:</strong> I'm not savvy with how modern BSD-based OS internals work - but is <code>kqueue()</code> built on <code>aio</code> or visa-versa?

696646,Refactoring Crystal Reports: whether to to what and why?,<p>Report design generation and maintenance isn't hard but it is dull. We have a number of legacy (to quite different degrees of legacy) reports in Crystal Reports XI. These are designed for A4/PDF - not necessarily printed but to be of a predictable layout and there's no possibility of us retiring them any time soon. </p> <p>All connect to existing stored procedures (SQL Server 2005) to acquire their data. A lot of time has been sunk in getting these reports to look <em>just so</em>. The actual creation of reports is mostly done via the .NET/C# API and exported to PDF. There are a number of locally developed and maintained applications that are stable and handle this process well. </p> <p>So we like the fact that Crystal Reports is stable that our apps produce these reports reliably that the PDF output is consistent and that when the Crystal Reports template is approved and set it just works. </p> <p>There are some big problems with this situation though. The biggest being that any changes to the underlying report templates themselves are a huge pain; getting the Crystal Reports template to a point that users are happy is a royal hassle and can involve a long iteration of DTP/graphics/database/reconciliation and myriad other niggles. </p> <p>Combine that with Crystal Reports being a relatively rare skill and not one people want to admit to we are trying to think up alternative solutions. </p> <p>Some thoughts I've started to consider - and any others welcome! </p> <ul> <li>Does Crystal Reports 2008 offer any benefits over XI? </li> <li>How have others managed a migration away from CR? And what to? </li> <li>Given the data access layer is well formed perhaps generate graphs via an Excel service and then import them as graphics to a framework template? Crystal another - has anyone tried anything like this? </li> <li>Is Reporting Services any better? (We have some RS skillz but again another thing that people are loath to actually own up to knowing anything about.) </li> <li>Are there any layout tools available (preferably with a .NET API) for what in the old days would be called Desktop Publishing? If we have graphics/tables/other objects as images that could then be rendering automatically </li> </ul> <p>Ideally I want to move to a solution where the users are in greater control of the underlying changes and whether this can be handled programatically within tools that we can provide to them and so that I can be coding rather than editing Crystal Reports templates. </p>,714798,2,0,,3/30/2009 10:01:48,,4/3/2009 17:07:58,,,,Unsliced,2902,,1,0,layout|crystal-reports|reporting|graphing,368

30326260,How to subset all rows from data frame for repeated measures,<p>The background for my question is: I have a dataset consisting of repeated measures one data point per row. These data are from a longitudinal study and therefore at the moment not every subject has all data points.</p> <p>I would like to be able to extract all data points the meet a criteria i.e. all repeated measures or those with two repeated measures.</p> <p>Here's a simplified example:</p> <pre><code>subject.id &lt;- c( 0 0 0 1 1 1 2 2 3 ) visit &lt;- c( 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 0 ) data.value &lt;- c( 32 35 38 12 18 24 9 13 21 ) data.from.study &lt;- data.frame( subject.id visit data.value ) </code></pre> <p>which results in:</p> <pre><code> subject.id visit data.value 1 0 0 32 2 0 1 35 3 0 2 38 4 1 0 12 5 1 1 18 6 1 2 24 7 2 0 9 8 2 1 13 9 3 0 21 </code></pre> <p>So:</p> <ul> <li>Subjects 0 and 1 have baseline and two repeated measures</li> <li>Subject 2 has the baseline measure and one repeated measure and</li> <li>Subject 3 only has the baseline measure.</li> </ul> <p>I would like to be able to selectively subset for all subjects which have two repeated measures (or one or just baseline) where all there data is included i.e.:</p> <pre><code>&gt; data.2.measures &lt;- ?? &gt; data.2.measures subject.id visit data.value 1 0 0 32 2 0 1 35 3 0 2 38 4 1 0 12 5 1 1 18 6 1 2 24 </code></pre> <p>I'm able to subset for where - using this example - <em>visit == 2</em>. But then I don't see how I can also extract the data for visits 0 and 1 for those subjects with a second visit data point. Conceptually I can see that I know the subject.id and could somehow use this information but I'm not sure then how to subset using a list.

656121,Is there a better way to work with Flex Builder and the AMF Gateway?,<p>I'm using Flex Builder 3 to connect to a bunch of back-end code via the AMF gateway. Another developer packaged up all the AMF Gateway code into a war file. Here's my development process: </p> <ul> <li>Deploy most recent AMF-gateway.war file into local jboss server</li> <li>War file gets unpacked into [jboss]/server/tmp/deploy/tmp23241AMF-gateway-exp.war/ </li> <li>Run Flex Builder. Point application project at AMF Gateway tmp folder in 3 places (Flex server root folder Flex build output folder Flex compiler 'additional arguments' (pointing to location of services-config.xml). </li> </ul> <p>This setup means that whenever you start a debug session in Flex Builder it dumps working versions of the files into the AMF-gateway folder on the jboss server (which is aliased as /AMF-gateway). The thing is every time I restart jboss or deploy an updated AMF-gateway.war file it gets unpacked into a new temp folder with a new name and I need to change all the references in the Flex project. This happens several times a day and it's annoying. Can I streamline this configuration? I tried using an alias to that folder -- figuring I could script the change -- but Flex Builder didn't seem to like it. </p>,668676,2,2,,3/17/2009 21:34:50,,5/15/2013 22:14:37,,,,SkippyFlipjack,69095,,1,0,flex|jboss|amf|gateway,529

14126654,I'm stuck with some reflection in my Java project,<p>I've been working on a Bukkit plugin project for a while and I've finally decided to make a formal release. So in my crazy scramble to document everything about my project I decided to clean up some APIs for people that would like to use them. Now I've hit the wall with a single problem though. </p> <p>Basically in this API you must implement an interface and then register your implementation with a class that manages every implementation and also checks for/registers another variable with the PluginMetrics that are bundled inside the plugin. </p> <p>Here is my interface with the name and tracker fields being fields of concern:</p> <pre><code>public interface IAction { /** * Name of the action. */ String name = null; /** * Stores args passed to the action by the player. */ String[] args = null; /** * Holds the Metrics tracker object. */ Tracker tracker = null; ... } </code></pre> <p>And here is the method (and init() method) where all my issues arise:</p> <pre><code>public static void registerAction(final Class a) { try { store.put((String) a.getField( name ).get(a) a); log.exDebug(String.format( Action %s (%s) was registered.  (String) a.getField( name ).get(a) a.getCanonicalName())); try { Tracker metric = (Tracker) a.getField( tracker ).get(a); try { OpenAuth.getMetrics().addCustomData(metric); log.exDebug(String.format( Registered Metrics data tracker [%s] from %s.  metric.getColumnName() a.getCanonicalName())); } catch (java.lang.Exception e) { log.info( Exception occurred while registering Action data tracker. ); } } catch (java.lang.Exception e) { log.info( Exception occurred while registering Action data tracker. ); // e.printStackTrace(); } } catch (java.lang.Exception e) { log.info( Exception occurred while registering an Action. ); e.printStackTrace(); } } public static void init() { for (Actions a : Actions.values()) { try { registerAction(a.getAction()); } catch (java.lang.Exception e) { log.info( Exception occurred while initialising Actions enumerator. ); e.printStackTrace(); } } for (Object ob : classLoader.load().getClasses()) { Class c = null; try { c = (Class) ob; } catch (java.lang.Exception e) { log.info( Exception occurred while casting up external Action. ); e.printStackTrace(); } try { registerAction(c); } catch (java.lang.Exception e) { log.info( Exception occurred while registering external Action. ); e.printStackTrace(); } } } </code></pre> <p>And an example implementation:</p> <pre><code>public class FreezeStick implements IAction { public static final String name = freeze ; public static final Tracker tracker = new Tracker( FreezeStick ); private String[] args = null; private Session attached; private SessionController sc; private final LogHandler log = new LogHandler(); private final String permissible = openauth.action.freeze ; private OAServer server; private boolean used = false; protected OAPlayer sender; protected OAPlayer target; public FreezeStick(OAServer server Session attached) { this.server = server; this.sc = server.getController().getSessionController(); this.attached = attached; this.setSender(this.attached.getPlayer()); } -- etc.. -- </code></pre> <p>Every time <code>Tracker metric = (Tracker) a.getDeclaredField( tracker ).get(a);</code> happens it's reported as <code>null</code>. I've tried with a.getField() instead of a.getDeclaredField() but same problem. Both the name and tracker variables receive <code>private static and final</code> when they are declared in the implementations and using a.getField() on the name variable has worked fine ever since I first wrote this.</p> <p>If someone could point me in the right direction I would greatly appreciate it :) </p> <p>Also here is the exception that occurs if it helps with figuring out my problem any better:</p> <pre><code>2013-01-02 10:48:10 [INFO] [OpenAuth-debug] Action ban (me.maiome.openauth.actions.BanStick) was registered. 2013-01-02 10:48:10 [INFO] [OpenAuth] Exception occurred while adding Action data tracker. 2013-01-02 10:48:10 [SEVERE] java.lang.NullPointerException 2013-01-02 10:48:10 [SEVERE] at me.maiome.openauth.actions.Actions.registerAction(Actions.java:65) 2013-01-02 10:48:10 [SEVERE] at me.maiome.openauth.actions.Actions.init(Actions.java:104) 2013-01-02 10:48:10 [SEVERE] at me.maiome.openauth.bukkit.OpenAuth.onEnable(OpenAuth.java:230) 2013-01-02 10:48:10 [SEVERE] at org.bukkit.plugin.java.JavaPlugin.setEnabled(JavaPlugin.java:217) 2013-01-02 10:48:10 [SEVERE] at org.bukkit.plugin.java.JavaPluginLoader.enablePlugin(JavaPluginLoader.java:457) 2013-01-02 10:48:10 [SEVERE] at org.bukkit.plugin.SimplePluginManager.enablePlugin(SimplePluginManager.java:381) 2013-01-02 10:48:10 [SEVERE] at org.bukkit.craftbukkit.v1_4_6.CraftServer.loadPlugin(CraftServer.java:278) 2013-01-02 10:48:10 [SEVERE] at org.bukkit.craftbukkit.v1_4_6.CraftServer.enablePlugins(CraftServer.java:260) 2013-01-02 10:48:10 [SEVERE] at org.bukkit.craftbukkit.v1_4_6.CraftServer.&lt;init&gt;(CraftServer.java:214) 2013-01-02 10:48:10 [SEVERE] at net.minecraft.server.v1_4_6.PlayerList.&lt;init&gt;(PlayerList.java:52) 2013-01-02 10:48:10 [SEVERE] at net.minecraft.server.v1_4_6.DedicatedPlayerList.&lt;init&gt;(SourceFile:11) 2013-01-02 10:48:10 [SEVERE] at net.minecraft.server.v1_4_6.DedicatedServer.init(DedicatedServer.java:104) 2013-01-02 10:48:10 [SEVERE] at net.minecraft.server.v1_4_6.MinecraftServer.run(MinecraftServer.java:399) 2013-01-02 10:48:10 [SEVERE] at net.minecraft.server.v1_4_6.ThreadServerApplication.run(SourceFile:849) </code></pre>,14166391,3,0,,1/2/2013 16:52:41,,1/4/2013 22:57:57,1/2/2013 18:20:52,,1943649,pirogoeth,1943649,,1,0,java|reflection,204

452390,Best way to organize a class hierarchy including an overridable Update function,<p>I have a base class Foo that has an Update() function which I want to be called once per frame for every instance of that class. Given an object instance of this class called foo  then once per frame I will call foo->Update().</p> <p>I have a class Bar derived from my base class that also needs to update every frame.</p> <p>I could give the derived class an Update() function but then I would have to remember to call its base::Update() function - nothing enforces my requirement that the base::Update() function is called because I have overriden it and could easily just forget to (or choose not to) call the base:Update function.</p> <p>So as an alternative I could give the base class a protected OnUpdate() function which could be made overrideable and call it from the base::Update() function. This removes the onus on me to remember to call base::Update() from the derived update function because I'm no longer overriding it. A Bar instance called bar will have bar->Update() called on it; this will first call the base class' Update() method which will in turn call the overriden OnUpdate() function performing the derived class' necessary updates.</p> <p>Which solves everything. Except. What if I want to derive yet another updatable class this time from the Bar class.</p> <p>Baz (which derives from Bar) also has update requirements. If I put them in Baz's OnUpdate() function I'm back to the original problem in that I'd have to remember to tell Baz's OnUpdate() function to call Bar's OnUpdate() function otherwise Bar's OnUpdate() function wouldn't get called.</p> <p>So really I'd want Bar's OnUpdate() function to be non-overridable and instead for it to call an overridable function after it has done whatever it needed to do perhaps called OnUpdate2()...</p> <p>And if I wanted to derive yet another class? OnUpdate3? OnUpdate4? AfterUpdate?</p> <p>Is there a Better Way?</p> <p><hr /></p> <p>Further Info:</p> <p>My specific problem domain is a 3d world. I've decided my base class is a Locator (an object with a location and orientation).</p> <p>My first derived class is a PhysicsObject - a Locator that also has mass velocity collision information etc.</p> <p>My next derived class is a Camera - which derives from PhysicsObject. As well as position and velocity it also has information about the viewport depth of field etc.</p> <p><hr /></p> <p>MattK suggests simplifying the hierarchy - if a Locator is never referred to incorporate it into PhysicsObject.</p> <p>I'm also thinking about how I would go about turning the layout upside down and using composition instead of inheritance.</p> <p>Perhaps a Camera HAS physics properties. Perhaps a PhysicsObject HAS a location.</p> <p>I'll have to think some more about this problem.</p> <p><hr /></p> <p>I like Uri's approach: Observe the contract. Here's the rule - please follow it. Uri is right in that whatever kind of safeguards I try to put in anyone could circumvent them so perhaps in this case the simplest solution is best. All my update() functions are going to have the requirement of calling their base::update() function.</p> <p>Thanks for the help everyone!</p>,452417,3,0,,1/16/2009 23:21:23,,1/18/2009 13:23:39,1/18/2009 13:23:39,Tim Gradwell,16676,Tim Gradwell,16676,,1,1,c++|design,323
584463,How does zooming panning and rotating work?,<p>Using OpenGL I'm attempting to draw a primitive map of my campus.</p> <p>Can anyone explain to me how panning zooming and rotating is usually implemented?</p> <p>For example with panning and zooming is that simply me adjusting my viewport? So I plot and draw all my lines that compose my map and then as the user clicks and drags it adjusts my viewport? </p> <p>For panning does it shift the x/y values of my viewport and for zooming does it increase/decrease my viewport by some amount? What about for rotation?</p> <p>For rotation do I have to do affine transforms for each polyline that represents my campus map?

I'm trying to get my calculator to let me enter a number then click an operator (+ - x /) enter another number then hit an operator again and have the display update and be able to keep this going.</p> <p>Example I would like to be able to hit the following and have it display the total each time I hit an operator after the first:</p> <blockquote> <p>a + b / c - d = </p> </blockquote> <p>The code I have seems (to me) like it should work but it doesn't. What am I doing wrong?</p> <p>The following is the code I'm using when you hit an operator. By default wait is set to false. After running through the class once value1 is stored and wait is set to true and that works fine. From there it doesn't seem to work quite right:</p> <pre><code>class OperatorListener implements ActionListener { public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent event) { String input = event.getActionCommand(); // Set display as string String s = display.getText(); if (!wait) { // Convert first input string to double try { value1 = Double.valueOf(s.trim()).doubleValue(); } catch (NumberFormatException nfe) { System.out.println( NumberFormatException: + nfe.getMessage()); } dec = false; } else { // Convert second input string to double try { value2 = Double.valueOf(s.trim()).doubleValue(); } catch (NumberFormatException nfe) { System.out.println( NumberFormatException: + nfe.getMessage()); } // Determine operation to be performed if (operator == add ) { value1 = Operators.add(value1 value2); } else if (operator == subtract ) { value1 = Operators.subtract(value1 value2); } else if (operator == multiply ) { value1 = Operators.multiply(value1 value2); } else if (operator == divide ) { value1 = Operators.divide(value1 value2); } // Convert final value to string and display display.setText(Double.toString(value1)); dec = false; } // Determine operator hit if (input.equals( + )) { operator = add ; } else if (input.equals( - )) { operator = subtract ; } else if (input.equals( x )) { operator = multiply ; } else if (input.equals( / )) { operator = divide ; } // Set wait wait = true; } } </code></pre> <p>EDIT: Updated code to fix some confusion and update the if statement.

I am planning on writing and saving the script to a file called <code>/etc/init/heartbeat.conf</code> which I <em>believe</em> is the correct location and file extension for upstart scripts (please correct me if I'm wrong).</p> <p>Here is the contents of that script (which I have hacked together from various tutorials/examples online):</p> <pre><code>start on started network-manager script ping -i 30 192.168.1.1 | cat &gt;&gt; ~/heartbeat/ping.log end script </code></pre> <p>When I start my machine I don't get any GUI/gnome-related errors and don't see anything in <code>/var/log/syslog</code> but I also don't see any <code>ping</code> output in <code>~/heartbeat/ping.log</code>.

368832,Character encoding problem - PHP output read by .NET via HttpWebRequest,<p>I have a PHP script (running on a Linux server) that ouputs the names of some files on the server. It outputs these file names in a simple text-only format.</p> <p>This output is read from a VB.NET program by using HttpWebRequest HttpWebResponse and a StreamReader.</p> <p>The problem is that some of the file names being output contain... unusual characters. Specifically the section symbol (§). </p> <p>If I view the output of the PHP script in a web browser the symbol appears fine.</p> <p>But when I read the output of the PHP script into my .NET program the symbol doesn't appear correctly (it appears as a generic block symbol). </p> <p>I've tried all the different character encoding options that you can use when reading the response stream (from the HttpWebResponse). I've tried outputting the stream directly to a text file (no good) displaying it in a TextBox (no good) and even when viewing the results directly in the Visual Studio debugger the character appears as a block instead of as the section symbol. </p> <p>I've examined the output in a hex editor (as suggested by a related question <a href= http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29499/how-do-you-troubleshoot-character-encoding-problems >how do you troubleshoot character encoding problems</a>. </p> <p>When I write out the section symbol (§) from .NET itself the hex bytes I see representing it are c2 a7 (makes sense if it's unicode right? requires two bytes?). When I write out the output from the PHP script directly to a file and examine that with a hex editor the symbol shows up as ef bf bd - three bytes instead of two?</p> <p>I'm at a loss as to what to do - if I need to specify some other character encoding or if I'm missing something obvious about this. </p> <p>Here's the code that's used to get the output of the PHP script (VB-style comments modified so they appear correctly on this site):</p> <pre><code> Dim myRequest As HttpWebRequest = WebRequest.Create( http://www.example.com/sample.php ) Dim myResponse As HttpWebResponse = myRequest.GetResponse() // read the response stream Dim myReader As New StreamReader(myResponse.GetResponseStream()) // read the entire output in one block (just as an example) Dim theOutput as String = myReader.ReadToEnd() </code></pre> <p>Any ideas? </p> <ul> <li>Am I using the wrong kind of StreamReader?

I also copied &amp; pasted it directly from the file's name (in Windows) and from this web page itself - all gave the same hex value when written out (c2 a7).</li> <li>Yes the section symbol I'm talking about is U+00A7 (ALT+0167 on Windows according to Character Map).</li> <li>The content-type is set explicitly via <code>header('Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8');</code> right at the beginning of the PHP script.</li> </ul> <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p> <p>Figured it out myself but I couldn't have done it without the help from the people who answered.

709033,(network sockets) bytes stuck in Send Queue for 15 minutes; why?,<p>I have a Java program running on Windows (a Citrix machine) that dispatches a request to Java application servers on Linux; this dispatching mechanism is all custom.</p> <p>The Windows Java program (let's call it <code>W</code>) opens a listen socket to a port given by the OS say 1234 to receive results. Then it invokes a dispatch service on the server with a business request . This service splits the request and sends it to other servers (let's call them <code>S1 ... Sn</code>) and returns the number of jobs to the client synchronously.</p> <p>In my tests there are 13 jobs dispatched to a number of servers and within 2 seconds all servers have finished processing their jobs and try to send the results back to the <code>W</code>'s socket.</p> <p>I can see in the logs that 9 jobs are received by <code>W</code> (this number varies from test to test). So I try to look for the 4 remaining jobs. If I do a <code>netstat</code> on this Windows box I see that 4 sockets are open:</p> <pre><code>TCP W:4373 S5:48197 ESTABLISHED TCP W:4373 S5:48198 ESTABLISHED TCP W:4373 S6:57642 ESTABLISHED TCP W:4373 S7:48295 ESTABLISHED </code></pre> <p>If I do a thread dump of <code>W</code> I see 4 threads trying to read from these sockets and apparently stuck in <code>java.net.SocketInputStream.socketRead0(Native Method)</code>. </p> <p>If I go on each of the <code>S</code> boxes and do a <code>netstat</code> I see that some bytes are still in the Send Queue. This number of bytes does not move for 15 minutes. (The following is the aggregation of <code>netstat</code>s on the different machines):</p> <pre><code>Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address Foreign Addr State tcp 0 6385 S1:48197 W:4373 ESTABLISHED tcp 0 6005 S1:48198 W:4373 ESTABLISHED tcp 0 6868 S6:57642 W:4373 ESTABLISHED tcp 0 6787 S7:48295 W:4373 ESTABLISHED </code></pre> <p>If I do a thread dump of the servers I see the threads are also stuck in <code>java.net.SocketInputStream.socketRead0(Native Method)</code>. I would expect a write but maybe they're waiting for an ACK? (Not sure here; would it show in Java? Shouldn't it be handled by the TCP protocol directly?)</p> <p>Now the very strange thing is: after 15 minutes (and it's always 15 minutes) the results are received sockets are closed and everything continues as normal. </p> <p>This used to always work before. The <code>S</code> servers moved to a different data center so <code>W</code> and <code>S</code> are no longer in the same data center. Also <code>S</code> is behind a firewall. All ports should be authorized between <code>S</code> and <code>W</code> (I'm told). The mystery is really the 15 minute delay. I thought that it could be some protection against DDOS?</p> <p>I'm no network expert so I asked for help but nobody's available to help me. I spent 30 minutes with a guy capturing packets with Wireshark (formerly Ethereal) but for security reasons I cannot look at the result. He has to analyze this and get back to me. I asked for the firewall logs; same story.</p> <p>I'm not root or administrator on these boxes now I don't know what to do...

If we use <code>&lt;supportedVersion&gt;</code> to fix our code to 2.0.50727 what are the chances of changes between 2.0.50727.1434 and 2.0.50727.nnnn (some future release)? The data structures being serialized are arrays maps strings et cetera from the standard class libraries.</p> <p>Additionally is it guaranteed that a 2.0.50727 framework will be always installed even after further .NET upgrades?

Objects created by new must be deleted which does two things (remember them): calls the destructor then frees the memory.</p> <p>FQA: Translation: delete is a way to explictly call a destructor but it also deallocates the memory. You can also call a destructor without deallocating the memory. It's ugly and useless in most cases but you can do that.</p> </blockquote> <p>The destructor/constructor call is obviously normal C++ code. Guarantees used in the code directly result from the in placement new guarantees. It is <strong>the core of the standard</strong> it's rock solid thing. How can it be called dirty and be presented as something unreliable?</p> <p>Do you think it's possible that the in-placement and non-in-placement implementation of new are different? I'm thinking about some sick possibility that the regular new can for example put size of the memory block allocated before the block which in-placement new obviously would not do (because it doesn't allocate any memory).

It's for learning ruby but I would like to put it up online for personal use. I have some experience with Rails and many here have recommended Sinatra. I'm fine with either but I cannot find any information on how to use a text file instead of a database. Is there a good tutorial on how to do this somewhere or can anhyone offer any tips? </p> <p>The application is quite simple validates against a text file of a word list then finds all anagrams. I have been assuming that this should be quite simple but I'm stuck on importing that textfile into Rails (or Sinatra if i choose that way).

469899,How does one databind a custom type to TextBox.Text?,<p>I have a custom c# type like (just an example):</p> <pre><code>public class MyVector { public double X {get; set;} public double Y {get; set;} public double Z {get; set;} //... } </code></pre> <p>And I want it to databind to TextBox.Text:</p> <pre><code>TextBox textBox; public MyVector MyVectorProperty { get; set;} //... textBox.DataBindings.Add( Text  this MyVectorProperty ); </code></pre> <p>Essentially I need conversion to and from a string for my custom value type. In the text box I want something like x y z that can be edited to update the vector type. I assumed that I could do so by adding a <code>TypeConverter</code> derived class:</p> <pre><code>public class MyVectorConverter : TypeConverter { public override bool CanConvertFrom(ITypeDescriptorContext context Type sourceType) { if (sourceType == typeof(string)) return true; //... return base.CanConvertFrom(context sourceType); } public override bool CanConvertTo(ITypeDescriptorContext context Type destinationType) { if (destinationType == typeof(string)) return true; //... return base.CanConvertTo(context destinationType); } public override object ConvertFrom(ITypeDescriptorContext context System.Globalization.CultureInfo culture object value) { if (value is string) { MyVector MyVector; //Parse MyVector from value return MyVector; } return base.ConvertFrom(context culture value); } public override object ConvertTo(ITypeDescriptorContext context System.Globalization.CultureInfo culture object value Type destinationType) { if (destinationType == typeof(string)) { string s; //serialize value to string s return s; } //... return base.ConvertTo(context culture value destinationType); } } </code></pre> <p>and associating it with my struct:</p> <pre><code>[TypeConverter(typeof(MyVectorConverter))] public class MyVector { //... } </code></pre> <p>This appears to complete half of the battle. I can see <code>MyVectorConverter</code> getting called into but something is amiss. It is called to see if it knows how to convert to string then it is called to convert to string. However it is never queried to see if it can convert FROM string nor to actually do the conversion. Furthermore right after an edit in the textbox the old value is immediately replaced (another CanConvertTo and ConvertTo sequence restoring the old value). The end result is that the newly typed entry in the text box is reverted immediately after it is applied. </p> <p>I feel as if there is just something simple missing. Is there? Is this entire project/approach doomed to failure? Does anyone else attempt such madness? How does one bi-directionally bind a custom multipart type to a string-based control?</p> <p><b>Solution:</b> Bizarrely all that is needed is for the formatting to be enabled on the Binding object.

The lexer logic should be clear and easy to understand</li> <li>Maintainability. Finding and fixing a bug should not be a nightmare!</li> <li>Interference in the build process.

301577,Why does Visual Studio 2008 forget where to dock my add-in's window pane?,<p>I wrote a simple add-in for Visual Studio 2008 that opens a dockable window pane. </p> <p><a href= http://www.codeplex.com/ora >You can download the source and a binary installer by clicking here.</a></p> <p>The nature of the add-in means that it is ideally going to stay docked next to where you edit your source. But sometimes on some installs it won't stay docked. You run VS you dock my pane you shutdown VS you restart VS and dang it - the pane is floating again. On some machines I have to re-dock it every time.</p> <p>But on other installs it stays docked wherever I put it forever. I originally thought it might be a difference between Vista and XP but now I have reports of it coming unstuck on XP as well.</p> <p>From what I've read (and the fact that it sometimes stays docked) I get the impression that VS is supposed to take care of saving the docking state for me. But it isn't doing that. And yet other plugins on the same VS install don't have this problem. So there has to be something I can do to improve the situation.</p> <p>I suspect the only relevant part of my code is this:</p> <pre><code>public class Connect : IDTExtensibility2 { private static DTE2 _applicationObject; private AddIn _addInInstance; private static CodeModelEvents _codeModelEvents; public static DTE2 VisualStudioApplication { get { return _applicationObject; } } public static CodeModelEvents CodeModelEvents { get { return _codeModelEvents; } } public static event EventHandler SourceChanged = delegate { }; public void OnConnection(object application ext_ConnectMode connectMode object addInInst ref Array custom) { _applicationObject = (DTE2)application; _addInInstance = (AddIn)addInInst; } public void OnStartupComplete(ref Array custom) { try { Events2 events = (Events2)_applicationObject.Events; _codeModelEvents = events.get_CodeModelEvents(null); object objTemp = null; Windows2 toolWins = (Windows2)_applicationObject.Windows; Window toolWin = toolWins.CreateToolWindow2( _addInInstance GetType().Assembly.Location Ora.OraPane  Ora  {DC8A399C-D9B3-40f9-90E2-EAA16F0FBF94}  ref objTemp); toolWin.Visible = true; } catch (Exception ex) { MessageBox.Show( Exception: + ex.Message); } } public void OnBeginShutdown(ref Array custom) { } public void OnDisconnection(ext_DisconnectMode disconnectMode ref Array custom) { } public void OnAddInsUpdate(ref Array custom) { } } </code></pre> <p>(The MSDN docs suggest that the window should be created in OnConnection but if I do that then the window mostly doesn't appear.)</p>,313046,4,0,,11/19/2008 11:05:02,3,8/19/2012 17:47:32,,,,Earwicker,27423,,1,8,visual-studio|visual-studio-2008|add-in|visual-studio-addins|docking,2667
160298,Django/Python - Grouping objects by common set from a many-to-many relationships,<p>This is a part algorithm-logic question (how to do it) part implementation question (how to do it best!). I'm working with Django so I thought I'd share with that.</p> <p>In Python it's worth mentioning that the problem is somewhat related to <a href= http://stackoverflow.com/questions/773/how-do-i-use-pythons-itertoolsgroupby >how-do-i-use-pythons-itertoolsgroupby</a>.</p> <p>Suppose you're given two Django Model-derived classes:</p> <pre><code>from django.db import models class Car(models.Model): mods = models.ManyToManyField(Representative) </code></pre> <p>and</p> <pre><code>from django.db import models class Mods(models.Model): ... </code></pre> <p>How does one get a list of Cars grouped by Cars with a common set of Mods?</p> <p>I.e. I want to get a class likeso:</p> <pre><code>Cars_by_common_mods = [ { mods: { 'a' } cars: { 'W1' 'W2' } } { mods: { 'a' 'b' } cars: { 'X1' 'X2' 'X3' } } { mods: { 'b' } cars: { 'Y1' 'Y2' } } { mods: { 'a' 'b' 'c' } cars: { 'Z1' } } ] </code></pre> <p>I've been thinking of something like:</p> <pre><code>def cars_by_common_mods(): cars = Cars.objects.all() mod_list = [] for car in cars: mod_list.append( { 'car': car 'mods': list(car.mods.all()) } ret = [] for key mods_group in groupby(list(mods) lambda x: set(x.mods)): ret.append(mods_group) return ret </code></pre> <p>However that doesn't work because (perhaps among other reasons) the groupby doesn't seem to group by the mods sets. I guess the mod_list has to be sorted to work with groupby.

385327,What setting in vim counteracts smartindent's refusal to indent # comments in shell scripts?,<p>I recently started using vim 7 (previously vim 6) and the <code>smartindent</code> setting. For the most part it works well though I'm so used to typing a tab after an open brace that it is almost counter-productive.</p> <p>However there is one piece of maniacal behaviour. When editing a shell script I try to create a comment at the current indent level but <code>smartindent</code> will have nothing to do with it. It insists that the comment must be at level 0 (no indent). What's worse it breaks shift-right ('<code>&gt;&gt;</code>' and friends) so that they do not work. This is outright insubordination and I'd like to know what's the best way to fix it?</p> <p>(I'm also not keen on <code>smartindent</code>'s ideas about indenting <code>then</code> after <code>if</code>.)</p> <p>Preferred solutions will save me manual bashing - I'm being lazy. One option would be 'turn off <code>smartindent</code> when editing shell scripts (leave it on for the rest)'. Another option would be guidelines on how to find the control script for <code>smartindent</code> and what to edit to change the characteristics I don't like. The final option (which I don't need advice on how to do - just the hint that it is the best or only way to restore sanity) is to leave <code>smartindent</code> unset.</p> <p>I saw the vaguely related question on <a href= http://stackoverflow.com/questions/313359/annoying-vim-unindent-rules >(PHP and) annoying vim unindent rules</a> ; it doesn't provide me with the direct answer though maybe the <code>cindent</code> and related items mentioned in there are in fact part of the answer.</p>,385343,7,1,,12/22/2008 1:33:47,3,2/24/2010 4:47:45,,,,Jonathan Leffler,15168,,1,19,shell|vim|auto-indent,7412

238728,Security - is it ok to send a username and password via HTTP GET?,<p>We are an organisation who have purchased a system which is used by doctors to view test results of patients (quite sensitive information). Being a programmer I have poked and prodded with the system and found that it submits the username and password via a HTTP GET request. On the domain it is run on all computers are set to bypass the proxy so the URL with the request won't be saved in some proxy log somewhere. But I would argue this is an unsafe way of handling username and passwords anyway.</p> <p>The vendor will argue that since we never asked for it it will be an 'enhancement' which will require additional $$$. (We never wrote the specifications for the system in the first place).</p> <p>What kind of case could I make to management to make them feel this isn't to standard and that probably the only way this system would be secure is through HTTPS?</p> <p>EDIT: Thanks for all your responses! I have raised the issue with the project leader her response was along the lines of what's HTTP? . So I plan to explain it all to her in better detail investigate the legal implications and try to raise the issue with the programmers directly asking why they went that path.

493177,How can I profile file I/O?,<p>Our build is annoyingly slow. It's a Java system built with <a href= http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Ant rel= nofollow >Ant</a> and I'm running mine on Windows XP. Depending on the hardware it can take between 5 to 15 minutes to complete. </p> <p>Watching overall performance metrics on the machine as well as correlating hardware differences with build times indicates that the process is I/O bound. It also shows that the process does a lot more reading than writing.</p> <p>However I haven't found a good way to determine <em>which</em> files are being read or written and how many times. My suspicion is that with our many subprojects and subsequent invocations of the compiler the build is re-reading the same commonly used libraries many times.</p> <p>What are some profiling tools that will tell me what a given process is doing with which files? Free is nice but not essential.</p> <hr> <p>Using <a href= http://stackoverflow.com/questions/493177/how-can-i-profile-file-i-o/493201#493201 >Process Monitor as suggested by Jon Skeet</a> I was able to confirm my suspicion: almost all of the disk activity was reading and re-reading of libraries with the JDK's copies of rt.jar and other libraries at the top of the list. I can't make a RAM disk large enough to hold all the libraries I used but mounting the hottest libraries on a RAM disk cut build times by about 40%; clearly Windows file system caching isn't doing a good enough job even though I've told Windows to optimize for that. </p> <p>One interesting thing I noticed is that the typical 'read' operation on a <a href= http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAR_%28file_format%29 rel= nofollow >JAR</a> file is just a few dozen bytes; usually there are two or three of these followed by a skip several kilobytes further on in the file. It appeared to be ill-suited to bulk reads.</p> <p>I'm going to do more testing with <em>all</em> of my third-party libraries on a flash drive and see what effect that has.</p>,493201,5,2,,1/29/2009 20:08:53,6,11/3/2013 11:35:23,11/3/2013 11:35:23,erickson,63550,erickson,3474,,1,8,java|windows|build-process|profiling,3039

566186,JTable with a complex editor,<p>I have many custom editors for a JTable and it's an understatement to say that the usability particularly in regard to editing with the keyboard is lacking.</p> <p>The main reason for this is that my editors are always created with a similar (though often more complex) situation to this:</p> <pre><code>@Override public Component getTableCellEditorComponent(JTable table Object value boolean isSelected int row int column) { JPanel container = new JPanel(); container.setLayout(new BorderLayout()); container.add(field BorderLayout.CENTER); field.setText((String) value); container.add(new JButton( ... ) BorderLayout.EAST); return container; } </code></pre> <p>I.E a panel with more than one component inside. The actual text editor is a descendant of the component being returned as the editor. So rendering issues aside from what I can tell the JTable is focusing the component that is returned by the <code>getTableCellEditorComponent</code> method so when you press a key with a cell highlighted it passes focus and the key press to the panel thinking that's the editor.<br /> Is there anyway I can inform JTable that the real editor is the JTextfield? Adding a hacky <code>requestFocusInWindow</code> on the correct component is insufficient as the key press won't get passed on.</p>,577021,5,0,,2/19/2009 16:49:11,8,11/15/2012 21:09:51,,,,Tom Martin,5303,,1,8,java|user-interface|swing|editor|jtable,8959

Additionally you cannot set this property to false for nullable value types.

263457,Merging/adding lists in Python,<p>I'm pretty sure there should be a more Pythonic way of doing this - but I can't think of one: How can I merge a two-dimensional list into a one-dimensional list?

However I have no experience making real functional websites. It has become apparent to me that I need to expand my skills to encompass web development. I have been using Ruby to develop applications but I am aware that it is quite popular for web development.

Is it best to use free CSS templates and WordPress as a foundation for my site or make it from scratch? Should I use GUI tools or write it all in Vim/Emacs?

86105,How can I supress the browser's authentication dialog?,<p>My web application has a login page that submits authentication credentials via an AJAX call. If the user enters the correct username and password everything is fine but if not the following happens:</p> <ol> <li>The web server determines that although the request included a well-formed Authorization header the credentials in the header do not successfully authenticate.</li> <li>The web server returns a 401 status code and includes one or more WWW-Authenticate headers listing the supported authentication types.</li> <li>The browser detects that the response to my call on the XMLHttpRequest object is a 401 and the response includes WWW-Authenticate headers. It then pops up an authentication dialog asking again for the username and password.</li> </ol> <p>This is all fine up until step 3. I don't want the dialog to pop up I want want to handle the 401 response in my AJAX callback function. (For example by displaying an error message on the login page.) I want the user to re-enter their username and password of course but I want them to see my friendly reassuring login form not the browser's ugly default authentication dialog.</p> <p>Incidentally I have no control over the server so having it return a custom status code (i.e. something other than a 401) is not an option.</p> <p>Is there any way I can suppress the authentication dialog? In particular can I suppress the Authentication Required dialog in Firefox 2 or later? Is there any way to suppress the Connect to <em>[host]</em> dialog in IE 6 and later?</p> <p><hr /></p> <p><strong>Edit</strong><br /> <em>Additional information from the author (Sept. 18):</em><br /> I should add that the real problem with the browser's authentication dialog popping up is that it give insufficient information to the user.</p> <p>The user has just entered a username and password via the form on the login page he believes he has typed them both correctly and he has clicked the submit button or hit enter. His expectation is that he will be taken to the next page or perhaps told that he has entered his information incorrectly and should try again. However he is instead presented with an unexpected dialog box.</p> <p>The dialog makes no acknowledgment of the fact he just <em>did</em> enter a username and password. It does not clearly state that there was a problem and that he should try again. Instead the dialog box presents the user with cryptic information like The site says: '<em>[realm]</em>'. Where <em>[realm]</em> is a short realm name that only a programmer could love.</p> <p>Web broswer designers take note: no one would ask how to suppress the authentication dialog if the dialog itself were simply more user-friendly. The <em>entire</em> reason that I am doing a login form is that our product management team rightly considers the browsers' authentication dialogs to be awful.</p>,90811,10,1,,9/17/2008 18:22:03,23,5/24/2016 11:16:31,6/26/2009 1:17:57,dgvid,52963,dgvid,9897,,1,55,javascript|ajax|http-authentication,31752

Because it uses <code>multiprocessing</code> there is module-level multiprocessing-aware log <code>LOG = multiprocessing.get_logger()</code>. Per <a href= http://docs.python.org/library/multiprocessing.html#logging >the docs</a> this logger has process-shared locks so that you don't garble things up in <code>sys.stderr</code> (or whatever filehandle) by having multiple processes writing to it simultaneously.</p> <p>The issue I have now is that the other modules in the framework are not multiprocessing-aware.

Everything looks fine when the browser size is 100% but when I start making the browser smaller with CTRL+scrollwheel or CTRL+minus the rightmost margin shrinks down too fast and eventually becomes zero forcing my rightmost floated inner div to fall down below the other two!</p> <p>I can't make sense out of this almost seems like some integer division is being performed incorrectly in the browser code but alas firefox and chrome both display the same result.</p> <p>Here is the example (just zoom out with CTRL-minus to see what I mean):</p> <p><a href= http://timescapezone.com/test/test1/ rel= nofollow >Click Here to View What I Mean on Example Site</a></p> <p>Just to narrow things down a bit the tags of interest are the following:</p> <blockquote> <pre><code>div#mainContent div#contentLeft div#contentCenter div#contentRight </code></pre> </blockquote> <p>I've searched stackoverflow for an answer and found the following posts which seem related to my question but was not able to apply them to the problem I am experiencing:</p> <blockquote> <p>http:// stackoverflow.com/questions/6955313/div-moves-incorrectly-on-browser-resize</p> <p>http:// stackoverflow.com/questions/18246882/divs-move-when-resizing-page</p> <p>http:// stackoverflow.com/questions/17637231/moving-an-image-when-browser-resizes</p> <p>http:// stackoverflow.com/questions/5316380/how-to-stop-divs-moving-when-the-browser-is-resized</p> </blockquote> <p>I've duplicated the html and css code below for your convenience:</p> <p>Here is the HTML:</p> <pre><code>&lt;!doctype html&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;meta charset= utf-8 &gt; &lt;title&gt;Pinco&lt;/title&gt; &lt;link href= css/style.css rel= stylesheet type= text/css &gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;div id= wrapper &gt; &lt;header&gt; &lt;div class= logo &gt; &lt;a href= http://pinco.com &gt; &lt;img class= logo src= images/PincoLogo5.png alt= Pinco /&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class= titolo &gt; &lt;h1&gt;Benvenuti!&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Siete arrivati al sito pinco.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;nav&gt; &lt;ul class= menu &gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href= # &gt;Menù Qui&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href= # &gt;Menù Quo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href= # &gt;Menù Qua&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/nav&gt; &lt;/header&gt; &lt;div id= mainContent &gt; &lt;div id= contentLeft &gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;article&gt; &lt;p&gt; Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipiscing elit.

One solution is to do the following:</p> <pre><code>div#contentRight { height: 900px; float: left; margin: 0 0 /* 15px */ 0 15px; border: 1px solid black; padding: 15px; width: 268px; background: #ccc; } </code></pre> <p>so that now the right column has no right margin but the visual result is the same. Now when I zoom out the rightmost column does not fall down but its right margin is so small compared to the others so really there is still a small problem.</p> <h2><strong>Edit 2:</strong></h2> <p>OK I've done some more searching and found an even better solution. The solution consists in having the margins in between the div column elements the same and having the left and right margin adjust automatically. In order to achieve this I had to do away with floats and use display: inline-block which IMHO is much more suitable than floats and was designed for the purpose at hand:</p> <pre><code>div#mainContent { padding: 15px 0; width: 960px; text-align: center; } div#contentLeft { display: inline-block; vertical-align: top; height: 900px; margin: 0 0 0 0/*15px*/; border: 1px solid black; padding: 15px; width: 268px; background: #ccc; } div#contentCenter { display: inline-block; vertical-align: top; height: 900px; margin: 0 0 0 15px; border: 1px solid transparent; padding: 15px; width: 268px; background: #E00; } div#contentRight { display: inline-block; vertical-align: top; height: 900px; margin: 0 0/* 15px */ 0 15px; border: 1px solid black; padding: 15px; width: 268px; background: #ccc; } </code></pre> <p>div#mainContent section { text-align: justify; }</p> <p>Now at a normal zoom level all left margins will be 15px plus the last element's right margin which will also be 15px. On the other hand if I zoom out there is some pixel rounding going on but the rounding is applied more or less equally on both sides which is somewhat better. This works in Firefox.</p> <h2><strong>Edit 3:</strong></h2> <p>Alas I've tried reducing the in-between margins a bit which makes the problem go away with Chrome but one of the div elements still drops down in IE10.</p> <pre><code>div#mainContent { padding: 15px 0; text-align: center; } div#contentLeft { display: inline-block; vertical-align: top; height: 900px; margin: 0 0 0 0/* 20px increased from 15px */; border: 1px solid black; padding: 15px; width: 268px; background: #ccc; overflow: hidden; } div#contentCenter { display: inline-block; vertical-align: top; height: 900px; margin: 0 0 0 10px/* reduced from 15px */; border: 1px solid transparent; padding: 15px; width: 268px; background: #E00; overflow: hidden; } div#contentRight { display: inline-block; vertical-align: top; height: 900px; margin: 0 0/* 20px increased from 15px */ 0 10px/* reduced from 15px */; border: 1px solid black; padding: 15px; width: 268px; background: #ccc; overflow: hidden; } div#mainContent section { text-align: justify; } </code></pre> <h2><strong>Edit 4:</strong></h2> <p>I've come up with a solution which works in Firefox Chrome and IE10. Basically I've created three div wrappers around the three columns and taken measurements again ensuring all measurements are symmetric.

596970,CSS: Simulating flexible width (without min-width)-,<p>I have a DIV container of 100% width holding x divs. The last child DIV floats right the rest float left. All child DIV's remain in a line so long as they fit in the bar (all oriented left except for the last div which sits by itself on the right). If the window is resized smaller and the children don't have enough room they collapse from their horizontal orientation (which I don't want). To fix this I know I can set a min-width of the DIV container the issue is that there is a variable amount of DIVs in the container of variable width. I'd like to simulate being able to set a min-width where of the container where min-width = width of all children but I cannot compute these because they are variable (which would simulate flexible space between the right div and the rest but not let them get closer than they should be allowed (hence collapsing the divs)).</p> <p>I know this is a little unclear so here's a picture: <img src= http://i.stack.imgur.com/sCVxE.jpg alt= http://img3.imageshack.us/img3/933/barfuo.jpg ></p> <p>Thanks!</p>,597004,1,0,,2/27/2009 22:44:20,,7/20/2013 2:17:08,7/20/2013 2:17:08,,2556654,Nic,72065,,1,5,css,6160

14073723,How to get a screen switch be fling in android?,<p>I am creating an Android app and would like to provide several layouts that can be switched by flinging (like Android home screens). I got the layouts to switch be flinging using this code:</p> <pre><code>public boolean onFling(MotionEvent e1 MotionEvent e2 float velocityX float velocityY) { if (e1.getX() - e2.getX() &gt; SWIPE_MIN_DISTANCE) { //vFlipper is a ViewFlipper but it is not important for me to have it. As long as I can display several layouts and switch them by thumb touch in a way that the layout will follow the thumb that's fine. if (vFlipper.getDisplayedChild() == 0) return false; vFlipper.setInAnimation(AnimationUtils.loadAnimation(this R.anim.left_in)); vFlipper.setOutAnimation(AnimationUtils.loadAnimation(this R.anim.left_out)); vFlipper.showPrevious(); } else if (e2.getX() - e1.getX() &gt; SWIPE_MIN_DISTANCE) { if (vFlipper.getDisplayedChild() == vFlipper.getChildCount() - 1) return false; vFlipper.setInAnimation(AnimationUtils.loadAnimation(this R.anim.right_in)); vFlipper.setOutAnimation(AnimationUtils.loadAnimation(this R.anim.right_out)); vFlipper.showNext(); } return true; } </code></pre> <p>but this doesn't work quite like the home screen. On the home screen you can pull the screen to the side and see it moving not having to complete the fling and switch the screen. The screen moves with your thumb. My code checks for a complete fling gesture and then fires the switching and the animation. Now I realize a full solution will probably drop the GestureDetector and the onFling method and use the onMove event but I don't know how to implement it and what to put in the onMove method. If you know of a good clear demonstration of this video or written a link will be most appreciated. If you don't care writing such a demonstration that will also be appreciated.</p>,14073851,1,2,,12/28/2012 18:02:05,,12/28/2012 18:12:33,,,,user1545072,,,1,0,android|touch|homescreen|onfling,197

450933,How to make a visual studio add-in that cannot be unloaded?,<p>I'm writing a Visual Studio add-in using C/C++. I am not familiar with the COM architecture. In fact I'm learning Windows programming. </p> <p>I can see an OnDisconnect() call back into my add-in. I tried returning S_FALSE but that does not seem to stop the add-in from being unloaded. </p> <p>So my questions is is it possible to make an add-in that cannot be unloaded (either through the Tools menu or programatically) and if yes will some magic return value from OnDisconnect() do the job or some other trick is required?</p> <p>I also saw another <a href= http://stackoverflow.com/questions/346674/visual-studio-and-add-in-unloading >question</a> that asks exactly the opposite. From the answer it seems that the DLL still resides in the memory when an add-in is unloaded. So maybe there is a way to reload the add-in as soon as it is unloaded? </p>,456164,1,6,,1/16/2009 16:09:38,,1/18/2009 23:59:34,,,,PolyThinker,47707,,1,0,visual-studio|visual-c++|add-in,160

7877494,Changing the default front page stub in Drupal 6,<p>In Drupal 6 one can go to the Site Configuration -> Site Information page and at the bottom there is a setting titled Default Front Page . The site URL (in text) there is unchangeable via the interface. However we have the wrong value there.</p> <p>This came about because I used the Backup/Restore module to copy a production site's data to a test server. It has to be a data problem because that is the single change that's happened. However I'm completely at a loss how to fix it. The original site's URL is all over the database.</p> <p>Simply wiping the database and reinstalling isn't an option because we need the node user CCK etc data from that production server.</p> <p>There are two suggestions I've seen all over the web to fix this: change the settings.php value and empty all Drupal's cache_* tables.</p> <p>In our case settings.php hasn't changed and is correct. And we have both used the Admin Menu interface to empty the cache and have manually gone in and made sure all cache tables are empty.</p>,7879018,2,0,,10/24/2011 14:49:19,,11/17/2011 11:02:34,11/17/2011 11:02:34,,225647,user550082,,,1,0,drupal|drupal-6,1241

24307006,Lua pattern similar to regex positive lookahead?,<p>I have a string which can contain any number of the delimiter <code>§\n</code>. I would like to remove all delimiters from a string except the last occurrence which should be left as-is.

There will never be any characters after the last variable delimiter.</p> <p>Here are 3 examples with the different state delimiters:</p> <pre><code>abc§\ndef§\nghi\n abc§\ndef§\nghi§\n abc§\ndef§\nghi§§\n </code></pre> <p>I would like to remove all delimiters <em>except</em> the last occurrence.</p> <p>So the result of gsub for the three examples above should be:</p> <pre><code>abcdefghi\n abcdefghi§\n abcdefghi§§\n </code></pre> <p>Using regular expressions one could use <code>§\\n(?=.)</code> which matches properly for all three cases using positive lookahead as there will never be any characters after the last variable delimiter.</p> <p>I know I could check if the string has the delimiter at the end and then after a substitution using the Lua pattern <code>§\n</code> I could add the delimiter back onto the string.

1440748,How can I find the index of the first element in my string using Java?,<p>I'm working on writing a simple Prolog interpreter in Java.</p> <p>How can I find the last character index of the first element either the head element or the tail element of a string in List Syntax ?</p> <p>List Syntax looks like:</p> <blockquote> <p>(X)<br /> (p a b)<br /> (func (func2 a) (func3 X Y))<br /> (equal eve (mother cain)) </p> </blockquote> <p>The head for each of those strings in order are:<br /> Head: X  Index: 1<br /> Head: p  Index: 1<br /> Head: func  Index: 4<br /> Head: equal  Index: 5 </p> <p>Basically I need to match the string that immediately follows the first ( and ends either with a space or a closing )  whichever comes first. I need the character index of the last character of the head element.</p> <p>How can I match and get this index in Java?</p> <p><hr /></p> <p>Brabster's solution is really close. However consider the case of:<br /> ((b X) Y)</p> <p>Where the head element is (b x). I attempted to fix it by removing ( from the scanner delimiters but it still hiccups because of the space between b and x .</p> <p>Similarly: ((((b W) X) Y) Z)</p> <p>Where the head is (((b w) x) Y).</p>,1440818,3,0,,9/17/2009 19:05:03,,9/17/2009 22:31:41,9/17/2009 20:04:19,Policho,,Policho,,,1,1,java|parsing|string|prolog,641
